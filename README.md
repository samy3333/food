#The recipe
*follow these instructions*
**Harvesting Cocoa & Cocoa processing**
*Pluck and open the Pods(Cocoa beans grow in pods that sprout off of the trunk and branches of cocoa trees. The pods are about the size of a football.)
*Ferment the cocoa seeds(Now the beans undergo the fermentation processing. They are either placed in large, shallow, heated trays or covered with large banana leaves. If the climate is right, they may be simply heated by the sun. )
*Dry the cocoa seeds(After fermentation, the cocoa seeds must be dried before they can be scooped into sacks and shipped to chocolate manufacturers.)
***Manufacturing Chocolate***
*Roast and Winnow the Cocoa( This develops the colour and flavour of the beans into what our modern palates expect from fine chocolate. The outer shell of the beans is removed.)
*Grind the Cocoa Nibs(The grinding process generates heat and the dry granular consistency of the cocoa nib is then turned into a liquid as the high amount of fat contained in the nib melts.)
*Blend Cocoa liquor and mold Chocolate(After the mixing process, the blend is further refined to bring the particle size of the added milk and sugar down to the desired fineness. )
*Mix this with the remaing ingredients to make the perfect chocolate
